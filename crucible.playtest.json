After each encounter, the party advances in level before facing their next test. Each battle is designed to introduce new gameplay mechanics and provide an opportunity to test out new abilities gained through level advancement.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Providing Feedback</h2><p>If you test Crucible and experience the Ring of Valor, please help us by taking a few moments to @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.5SgXrAKS2EnqVggJ.JournalEntryPage.4Ggutuh9uzhcEXSK]{Provide Feedback} in the <strong>#crucible</strong> channel of our community Discord server.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Regarding Defeat</h2><p>Normally, in Crucible - defeat whether by <strong>Insanity</strong> or <strong>Death</strong> would be the end of a character's journey. In the case of this initial playtest, however, we recommend that you as the Gamemaster adopt a more flexible approach.</p><p>In the interest of testing the system and collecting useful feedback, we recommend allowing a party who experiences defeat to re-attempt the same challenge until successful OR to be permitted to advance to the next challenge regardless should one of the daily challenges prove too difficult to be surmounted.</p>"

Duurath will close on enemy combatants using <strong>Shield Charge</strong> and lock them down using <strong>Cadence</strong> to deliver high damage or <strong>Counter Strike</strong> to retaliate when blocking incoming blows. Defensively, Duurath can use <strong>Kinetic Ward</strong> to protect himself from a chosen type of physical damage.</p><h4>Belladonna</h4><p><strong>Belladonna</strong> is a cunning and elusive melee combatant with the <strong>Poisoner</strong> talent. At the beginning of the battle she will activate <strong>Poison Blades</strong>. She will use <strong>Distract</strong> against enemy spellcasters to sap their Focus, and <strong>Combat Medicine</strong> to restore the health of her allies. Belladonna will seek out more vulnerable enemy combatants, closing to melee range using <strong>Tumble </strong>if necessary and <strong>Flurry</strong> to apply rapid damage and poisoned conditions.</p><h4>Eliorwen</h4><p><strong>Eliorwen</strong> is a deadly archer, infusing shots from her Longbow with lightning spells using her <strong>Arcane Archer</strong> talent. Eliorwen will identify a dangerous enemy and target them with <strong>Mark Prey</strong> to reduce their defenses for herself and her allies. She will use <strong>Precision Shot</strong> coupled with reduced cost <strong>Voltaic Arrow</strong> to deliver reliable sustained damage from a distance.</p><h4>Kagura</h4><p><strong>Kagura</strong> is a versatile support character able to heal both mind and body of her allies. She will cast the <strong>Life</strong> rune using either the <strong>Influence</strong>, <strong>Pulse</strong>, or <strong>Ray</strong> gestures to trigger additional healing from her <strong>Mender</strong> talent. Kagura can sustain healing nearly indefinitely through thoughtful use of the <strong>Compose</strong> inflection as well as <strong>Conserve Effort</strong>. Kagura avoids direct confrontation and instead will disengage from combat and seek protection from her allies.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Advancement</h2><p>The fight ends when all four adversaries are defeated.
