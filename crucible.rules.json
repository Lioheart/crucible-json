All Protagonists, even those at Level 1, are capable adventurers. They are smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - but not yet to a degree that is wondrous. As characters advance in level they attain tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is level-based. Increases in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and Talent points to spend which increase a character's power and capabilities. The maximum character level in Crucible is anticipated to be <strong>18</strong>.</p><p>If organizing a gameplay experience that seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your game at Level 1 is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an adventure with characters who are already established champions, beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Character creation is an easy six-step process described below. During creation, a character is considered to be \"Level Zero\" when they are allowed to make initial choices about their hero. Once the creation process is completed, the hero advances to Level 1.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 1 - Ancestry and Background</h2><p>The initial character creation process involves choosing one @UUID[.ovqgeiXHPrdiUXci]{Ancestry} and one @UUID[.uCwStnXHoUCV2TrK]{Background} which help to establish the character's backstory and starting attributes. To browse the provided options for playtest Ancestry or Background you can click the plus icon next to <strong>Choose Ancestry</strong> or <strong>Choose Background</strong>, or create your own custom option from scratch as a new <strong>Item</strong>. To add an Ancestry or Background to your sheet just drag and drop the item onto your character sheet.</p><section class=\"foundryvtt\"><p>You can clear an added Ancestry or Background by clicking the <strong>x</strong> icon at the top of the sheet, but you may only do this if you have not yet advanced further to Step 2 or beyond.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 2 - Spend Ability Points</h2><p>In addition to starting Ability score values provided by your Ancestry, each character begins with <strong>9 Ability Points</strong> which can be allocated towards any of the six@UUID[.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Ability Scores}. These Ability Scores are used to calculate a number of secondary attributes for your character, such as @UUID[.alkVSDmt0ec5HBfE]{Defenses} and @UUID[.FmmADsI9qo1uIIT3]{Resource} pools.</p><section class=\"foundryvtt\"><p>To spend Ability Points click the up or down arrows to the right of the desired Ability. When you have spent all 9 points, the Abilities section becomes locked to prevent further editing, but you can unlock this section by clicking the section lock toggle button.</p></section><p>You may only increase a single Ability Score a maximum of 3 times during character creation. A counter at the top of the Abilities section displays how many points you have remaining to spend.</p><p>Once you have advanced your character to <strong>Level 1</strong> the starting ability scores which you purchased can no longer be changed, but these ability scores may still be increased over time as you continue to level up.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 3 - Spend Skill Points</h2><p>Each character can invest into 12 different @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.CrucibleSkills00.JournalEntryPage.QQaQfv1cakIKltNz]{Skills} which represent various competencies and techniques that your character has mastered. Every character will begin with four Skill ranks which were provided by their Ancestry and Background. Additionally, each character begins with two Skill points which are further invested into Skills of the player's choosing. The cost to advance your rank in a Skill is described in the Character Skills documentation, but is automatically calculated when you add or remove ranks.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 4 - Spend Talent Points</h2><p>Each new character has 2 initial @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.veKSDiOWHLaF7Gok.JournalEntryPage.OmJNyYrgeaTwYE7L]{Talent} points which can be used to select powerful abilities that character can perform. Talents are a roadmap for your character's development, allowing you to invest into unique paths that provide powerful abilities.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 5 - Acquire Starting Equipment</h2><p>The final step of character creation is to acquire starting @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.e33DSvx0cfa7fey6.JournalEntryPage.6QxbcLoOhUkXTbAj]{Equipment} appropriate for your character level.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Specific rules for starting equipment are still a work in progress. For Playtest 1 start with any equipment you desire from the Armor or Weapons compendium packs. Note that you must mark your items as equipped in order for them to take effect on your character sheet.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Step 6 - Advancing to Level One</h2><p>Once you have chosen Ancestry and Background, spend initial Ability Points, invested into Skills and Talents, and acquired starting equipment your character advances to level 1. Advancing past level zero is a \"point of no return\", your initial choices become locked and may not be changed.

Crucible uses two separate pools to represent the hero's state of wellbeing.</p><h4>Health and Wounds</h4><p>The physical health of a character is modeled using two resource pools. <strong>Health</strong> is a temporary resource which begins full and is decreased when a character sustains damage in combat. <strong>Wounds</strong> are a permanent resource which increase when a character suffers greivous injury.</p><p>If the Health pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes <strong>Incapacitated</strong> and begins to suffer Wounds. If the Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes <strong>Dead</strong>.</p><h4>Morale and Madness</h4><p>The mental health of a character is similarly modeled using two resource pools. <strong>Morale</strong> is a temporary resource which begins full and is decreased as the character suffers stress or trauma. <strong>Madness</strong> is a permanent resource which increases when a character suffers greivous mental strain.</p><p>If the Morale pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes <strong>Broken</strong> and begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes <strong>Insane</strong>.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Capacity for Action</h2><p>Two resource pools define a character's ability to take action during game situations.</p><h4>Action</h4><p><strong>Action </strong>describes a character's capacity for rapid action during each round of a combat encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 6 Action, all six of which replenish at the start of their turn in combat.</p><h4>Focus</h4><p><strong>Focus</strong> describes a character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or magic. A character's Focus is replenished when they successfully rest, but during the midst of combat Focus must be used thoughtfully as it will not naturally replenish.</p><h4>Heroism</h4><p><strong>Heroism</strong> is a special generated resource that allows you to perform spectacular feats of magic or heroic prowess. Heroism is earned over the course of — typically longer — combat encounters allowing you to narratively unleash your most powerful abilities once the tension of battle has peaked!</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Recovering Resources</h2><p>During Combat, Health and Morale may only be recovered by Actions or Talents which provide <strong>Restoration</strong>. Outside of Combat, it is possible to use the <strong>Recover</strong> action which consumes 10 minutes of time and fully replenishes your Health, Morale, Action, and Focus pools.</p><p>In order to reduce the accumulation of Wounds or Madness, long-term <strong>Rest</strong> is required.

Success on a test against a defense target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system are:</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal to:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Physical Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Armor + Dodge + Parry + Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense components.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Protection offered by worn equipment or organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by Armor assume the <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome. Unlike other physical defense outcomes, Deflection still results in some damage as long as the attack roll was not a Critical Failure; more than 6 less than the Physical Defense target. The residual damage dealt from a Deflection is also called a <strong>Glancing Blow.</strong></p><h4>Dodge</h4><p>Protection offered by physical quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong> outcome. Dodged attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for dodge-based reactions.</p><h4>Parry</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Parry defense assume the <strong>Parried</strong> outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for parry-based reactions.</p><h4>Block</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are non-corporeal or intangible in nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively. Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Fortitude Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + Strength + Wisdom + Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong> and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Willpower Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + Toughness + Presence + Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to avoid harm that would otherwise occur in a specific area. Reflex is modified by <strong>Dexterity</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> which represent quickness of body and rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Reflex Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + Dexterity + Intellect + Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment. Adversary creatures have a -2 penalty to these defenses to compensate for their comparatively advantaged Ability score progression. This penalty increases for Adversaries with threat level below 1.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Healing Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Wounds / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Rallying Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Madness / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.

If you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a <strong>Boon</strong> to your Initiative roll for the following round.</p><blockquote><p>Re-rolling initiative every round introduces greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a variety of combat challenges.</p></blockquote><h4>Automatic Initiative</h4><p>Since <strong>Initiative</strong> automatically updates every <strong>Round</strong> of combat, players do not roll for Initiative themselves. Instead this process is automated that every character's initiative roll is automatically performed in order to maintain a satisfying pace to combat encounters.</p><h4>Incapacitated Combatants</h4><p>Combatants who are <strong>Incapacitated</strong> or <strong>Dead</strong> are automatically placed at Initiative 0 and their turns come last in each Round.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Escalation and Morale</h2><p>As the tension of combat escalates - so too do the consequences on <strong>Morale</strong> for combatants. After 6 Rounds of Combat at the start of each subsequent round, the combatant with the highest <strong>Initiative</strong> result gains additional Morale equal to the numbered <strong>Round</strong> of combat. The combatant with the lowest Initiative result (excluding Incapacitated and Dead combatants) loses Morale equal to the numbered Round of combat.</p>"

Attack Rolls are made when the effectiveness of an ability is evaluated in opposition to an opponent. Attack Rolls apply to weapon attacks, spell casts, healing abilities, and even some skill checks which are performed in combat.</p><p>The player whose character is performing the Attack is always the one to make the roll, while the effectiveness of the defending character or creature is based on their defense scores. The Attack Roll uses the same modified dice pool as a Standard Check, expressed as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Attack Roll</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[+Boons, -Banes] + Ability Modifier + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section><p>The 3d8 dice pool is modified by <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>. The ability modifier for the attack roll is determined by the scaling formula of the weapon type being used. The Skill Bonus for the attack roll is determined by the character's training in that particular weapon type. The Enchantment Bonus for the roll is determined by the magical properties (if any) of the weapon being used.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Determining Attack Outcomes</h2><p>The attack is a hit if the result of the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense score of the target. If the result of the attack roll is less than the Defense score, the attack is ineffective. For attacks which target Physical Defense the nature of the miss (Deflected, Blocked, Dodged, or Parried) is further determined by the component Physical Defense scores of the target creature.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Overflow and Damage</h2><p>The amount by which the Attack Roll exceeded the Defense score is called <strong>Overflow</strong>. This Overflow amount is multiplied by a <strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> which is usually 1, but occasionally higher or lower. Then any additive <strong>Damage Bonus</strong> is applied, and lastly any <strong>Resistance</strong> possessed by the target creature is subtracted from the result.</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Overflow</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Attack Roll - Defense Score</p></section><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Damage</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">(Overflow × Damage Multiplier) + Damage Bonus - Target Resistance</p></section><p>While Damage Resistance is a powerful way for creatures to reduce incoming damage, such damage cannot be mitigated entirely. Abilities which deal direct (immediate) damage that surpass the target's Defense Score always deal at least 1 point of damage to their target Resource.</p><p>Abilities which deal indirect damage-over-time, however, can have the effects of that indirect damage reduced to zero by Resistance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Critical Hits and Misses</h2><p>If the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Hit Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>. Similarly if the Attack Roll is lower than the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Miss Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Miss</strong>.</p><p>A Critical Hit does not directly increase the damage of an attack - although because of the way that Overflow contributes to total damage, Critical Hits always deal more damage than normal hits.</p><p>Critical Hits and Critical Misses present opportunities for other things to occur. Many talents allow your character to cause special effects when achieving a Critical Hit, or to react to an enemy if an incoming attack is a Critical Miss.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Critical Hit Effects</h4><p>Zenith the Monk has both the <strong>Concussive Blows</strong> and <strong>Battle Focus</strong> talents. Zenith rolls a <strong>29</strong> on a Strike attack against a terrible Swamp Troll with a <strong>19 Physical Defense</strong>.

The Pulse has a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the radius of the ability in grid spaces.</p><h4>Ray</h4><p>This action affects creatures in a straight line originating from the character performing the action. The Ray has a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the length of its effect in grid spaces.</p><h4>Self</h4><p>This action only involves or affects the character or creature which performs it. Self-target abilities affect no other creatures and have no range requirement.</p><h4>Single</h4><p>This action targets some number of individual creatures other than the creature which performs it. Single target actions also specify a <strong>Number</strong> which describes the number of creatures targeted and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the range of the ability in grid spaces.</p><h4>Wall</h4><p>This action targets creatures in a straight line perpendicular to the character performing the action.

The process of learning components and discovering new spell combinations is intended to provide a rewarding experience of magical experimentation and narrative development for characters which invest into Spellcraft.</p><p>It is useful to think of the rules and structure of the Spellcraft system linguistically. If you think of a spell as a sentence, each spell must have a Rune (noun) and a Gesture (verb), and may optionally include an Inflection (adjective/adverb) that modifies either.</p><p>Spells which attack an opponent follow the rules of @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.lZfPVvBSsCEqlte4]{Attack Rolls}, with changes to the Ability Bonus and Base Damage of the attack depending on the combination of Rune and Gesture used.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Zarajah the Pyromancer</h4><p>Zarajah is an ambitious Level 6 sorcerer who strives to master the arts of elemental magic. Zarajah knows the runes for <strong>Flame</strong>, <strong>Kinesis</strong>, and <strong>Lightning</strong> as well as gestures for <strong>Touch</strong> (automatically learned), <strong>Influence</strong>, and <strong>Arrow</strong>. Additionally, Zarajah has also learned the <strong>Quicken</strong> inflection. Using these components, Zarajah has access to 18 different combinations which form Spells.</p><p>Zarajah's favorite spell is <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> which allows her to hurl a projectile of arcane fire at a single target up to 10 spaces distant at the cost of <strong>1 Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong> points. The Flame rune targets <strong>Reflex</strong> defense and deals <strong>Fire Damage</strong> to <strong>Health</strong>. Arrow and Flame both scale using <strong>Intellect</strong>, so the effectiveness of this spell scales using only Intellect as a single ability score.</p><p>When Zarajah casts a <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> towards a swooping Manticore, she rolls a <strong>28</strong> on her spell attack roll, beating the Manticore's Reflex defense of <strong>21</strong>. This <strong>7 Overflow Damage</strong> is increased by the <strong>10 Base Damage</strong> of the Arrow gesture, resulting in a total of <strong>17 Fire Damage</strong> dealt to the foe.</p><p>Since this attack is also a Critical Hit, the Manticore bursts into flame due to Zarajah's <strong>Pyromancer</strong> talent which inflicts the <strong>Burning</strong> condition causing additional damage-over-time.</p></section><h2>The Cost of Magic</h2><p>Every magic spell has a cost- whether used within a combat situation or for out-of-combat benefits.

Left clicking any Node will expand it to reveal the Talents it may contain.</p><p>Left-clicking a Talent purchases that talent if you have points available, while right-clicking it will remove that talent from your character.</p><p>You may reset your purchases on the Talent Tree at any time by clicking the Reset button at the bottom.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Tree Layout</h2><p>Crucible's Talent Tree is divided into six sections, with each section representing a different @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Ability} which affects scaling and other aspects of those talents.</p><figure><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"systems/crucible/assets/journals/talent-explainer.webp\" /><figcaption>The Talent Tree is divided into sextants based on Abilities</figcaption></figure><p>The Talent Tree is composed of several subcomponents which help you plot growth and progression for your character.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Nodes</h2><p>Each sextant of the Talent tree is composed of a number of <strong>Nodes</strong> which can contain one or more <strong>Talents</strong>. A Node which lie closer to the border between two sextants will often feature abilities which relate to the themes of both ability scores.</p><p>Starting Nodes occur at the inner-most ring, and contain talents that are often prerequisites for later talents in the tree. These starter talents are best thought of as the first steps in defining what makes your character different from another in terms of their specific set of special abilities.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Talents</h2><p>Talents are the smallest unit of the talent tree. Each talent grants your character-specific abilities or bonuses. Many Talents have requirements which must be met before they can be purchased, such as attaining a certain level of Ability bonus or degree of training in a Skill.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Signature Talents</h2><p>Talent nodes at the outer edges of the Talent Tree contain <strong>Signature Talents</strong>, powerful bonuses that \"Spellblade\" or \"Dread Lord\" which offer iconic abilities. Signature Talents represent the culmination of the abilities required to select them, and are mirrored across two ability scores. Taking a Signature Talent forms a bridge to its paired ability score, allowing you to continue your path of progression into that sextant regardless of whether you have already purchased lower-tier Talents.</p>"

The system’s dice mechanics allow for crunchy and tactically rich encounters featuring combat, exploration, or social challenges.</p><p>Crucible is both a role-playing game and a software engine. The game system offers a deep level of mechanical sophistication, but its rules are entirely encoded to be applied with consistency and automation. The system is built intentionally to eliminate the cumbersome bookkeeping that is prevalent in high-crunch pen-and-paper systems.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Development Status</h2><p>Crucible is now available for an initial <strong>Alpha Playtest</strong> which provides the community with a first look at the system, design pillars, and intended direction. The system is moderately functional, but still early in development. All areas of the system are works-in-progress and some areas are not yet developed at all. This playtest offers a chance for us to collect early feedback and share our work with the community. Please approach it with an open mind and an understanding that what you are seeing is still a long way from a finished product.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Blocks like this one in the system documentation highlight areas of the system that still require substantial development. These are intended to make you aware of areas that are intentionally unfinished at this time.</p></section><p>Development of Crucible is two-pronged with an equal focus on developing the system mechanics of the roleplaying game and the software implementation of those mechanics simultaneously. As the game mechanics evolve, new developments of the game system will enable those features for use in testing. The playtest process allows us to solicit and benefit from feedback that helps us iterate on the game rules and the user experience in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. We anticipate hosting multiple rounds of feedback, each focusing on a different aspect of the game experience.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Playtest One</h2><p>The first playtest, @UUID[Compendium.crucible.playtest.Adventure.F8AILycmdj2kuOVa]{Playtest 1 - The Ring of Valor}, is focused on @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6]{Character Creation} and @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c]{Combat Encounters}. This playtest provides an abbreviated introduction to the Crucible game system, covering character creation, dice mechanics, combat encounters, and level advancement. The playtest begins at level 1 and advances characters through level 6 allowing them to evolve and advance their character between each challenge of the test.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Please note that the rules and mechanics featured in this playtest are not final. Most talents, skills, and rules will be further refined during later phases of development.</p></section>"

                    "text": "<p>Crucible is built with the following cornerstones and design principles in mind.</p><h2>Consequential Character Progression</h2><p>A primary goal for Crucible is to provide systems for meaningful, exciting, and impactful character progression. Creating and advancing a character in Crucible should be enjoyable and impactful as you gain access to new capabilities that tangibly evolve your playstyle and character persona.</p><h2>Strategic Grid-Based Combat</h2><p>Game mechanics in Crucible are designed for application to encounter or area maps with a structured grid which defines distances and positions of characters to create tactical choices about movement during combat. Movement actions and costs, engagement, flanking, cover, area-of-effect abilities, and more are all ways to add tactical nuance and dynamism to combat.</p><h2>Consistently Automated Mechanics</h2><p>A key goal for Crucible is to design and implement mechanics which are seamlessly automated or theoretically capable of seamless automation. We don't want automation that distracts from gameplay with the need for bookkeeping - but we also want the underlying game mechanics which are automated to be understandable to players at the table. We don't want mechanics which are inscrutable simply because we have a layer of automation in front of them. In Crucible you will find game mechanics which are elegantly and intuitively designed, but our approach to full automation of those mechanics means you can stay focused on the fun of roleplaying.</p><h2>Bring Your Own Story</h2><p>Crucible is optimized and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out over months or years of game sessions.</p><p>Crucible provides relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships - deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they most prefer.</p><p>Crucible intentionally does not define a canonical setting. The system provides Gamemasters with tools to apply the system to a variety of settings. As a general rule of thumb, Crucible will work best in a gritty fantasy setting but it can be adapted for other genres and tones.</p><h2>Ease of Powerful Use</h2><p>Crucible is designed to be a system which is easy to learn and easy to use. Gamemasters should feel empowered to tell the stories they want to tell, and players to play the characters they want to play. We want game mechanics in Crucible to be crunchy and strategic while being presented to players in a way that is intuitive and fun to engage with.</p>"
