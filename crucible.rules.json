If an encounter has too low an encounter level - in other words if it is too easy to overcome - it does not count towards character progression.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>The rules for computing Encounter Level are still a work in progress and are not included in Playtest 1.</p></section><h4>Milestone-Based Progression</h4><p>Milestone-based progression can be utilized as a more lightweight alternative to encounter-based progression in which it is left to the gamemaster to determine when a character has accomplished a significant feat that is deserving of advancement. This can be structured around the completion of quest objectives, the arrival of significant plot moments, or the vanquishing of notable foes.</p><p>When using Milestone based progression it is left to the Gamemaster to decide when the characters' deeds are deserving of level advancement.</p><blockquote><p>You can apply the concept of Milestone progression while still using the rules for Encounter-based advancement by ignoring Encounter Level and instead awarding a number of advancement points that you feel are appropriate upon the completion of any meaningful challenge.</p></blockquote>"

The higher a defense value, the harder it is to perform an action which targets that defense. Success on a test against a defense target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system are:</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal to:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Physical Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Armor + Dodge + Parry + Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense components.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Protection offered by worn equipment or organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by Armor assume the <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome. Unlike other physical defense outcomes, Deflection still results in some damage as long as the attack roll was not a Critical Failure; more than 6 less than the Physical Defense target. The residual damage dealt from a Deflection is also called a <strong>Glancing Blow.</strong></p><h4>Dodge</h4><p>Protection offered by physical quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong> outcome. Dodged attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for dodge-based reactions.</p><h4>Parry</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Parry defense assume the <strong>Parried</strong> outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for parry-based reactions.</p><h4>Block</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are non-corporeal or intangible in nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively. Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Fortitude Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + ((Strength + Wisdom) / 2) + Fortitude Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong> and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Willpower Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + ((Toughness + Presence) / 2) + Willpower Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to avoid harm that would otherwise occur in a specific area. Reflex is modified by <strong>Dexterity</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> which represent quickness of body and rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Reflex Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 2) + Reflex Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Healing Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Wounds / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Rallying Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Madness / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.

Your character's initiative during combat is determined by your Dexterity and Intellect attributes, any passive Initiative Bonus you may have, any situational bonus which allows you to react faster than usual, and an element of random chance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Rounds and Turns</h2><p>Each combat encounter is divided into <strong>Rounds</strong> and <strong>Turns</strong>. A <strong>Round</strong> refers to a single set of choices made by the characters in the encounter, where each character gets to act in an order defined by their <strong>Initiative</strong>. Each round loosely represents 10 seconds of real time, where 6 rounds of combat occur each minute of the encounter's duration. A <strong>Turn</strong> represents the actions taken by the one character whose turn it is to act in the initiative order.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Initiative Calculation</h2><p>Your initiative is determined by:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Initiative</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[Boons,Banes] + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 4)</p></section><p>A situational bonus to initiative could result from you getting the drop on an enemy, or benefiting from a magical spell which hastens your reactions, alternatively you could face a situational penalty to initiative if your reactions are dulled or slowed by alchemical or magical effects.</p><p>Each round of combat you have a pool of Action Points which you may elect to spend in various ways. If you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a <strong>Boon</strong> to your Initiative roll for the following round.</p><blockquote><p>Re-rolling initiative every round introduces greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a variety of combat challenges.</p></blockquote><h4>Automatic Initiative</h4><p>Since <strong>Initiative</strong> automatically updates every <strong>Round</strong> of combat, players do not roll for Initiative themselves. Instead this process is automated that every character's initiative roll is automatically performed in order to maintain a satisfying pace to combat encounters.</p><h4>Incapacitated Combatants</h4><p>Combatants who are <strong>Incapacitated</strong> or <strong>Dead</strong> are automatically placed at Initiative 0 and their turns come last in each Round.</p><h4>Tiebreaking Procedures</h4><p>Ties in initiative are resolved by applying the following tiebreaking criteria in order:</p><ol><li><p>Combatants with a higher passive <strong>Initiative</strong> bonus.</p></li><li><p>Combatants with more maximum <strong>Action</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adversaries</strong> act before <strong>Heroes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Any remaining ties are placed in alphabetical order.</p></li></ol><h2 class=\"divider\">Escalation and Morale</h2><p>As the tension of combat escalates - so too do the consequences on <strong>Morale</strong> for combatants. After 6 Rounds of Combat at the start of each subsequent round, the combatant with the highest <strong>Initiative</strong> result gains additional Morale equal to the numbered <strong>Round</strong> of combat. The combatant with the lowest Initiative result (excluding Incapacitated and Dead combatants) loses Morale equal to the numbered Round of combat.</p>"

The ability modifier for the attack roll is determined by the scaling formula of the weapon type being used. The Skill Bonus for the attack roll is determined by the character's training in that particular weapon type. The Enchantment Bonus for the roll is determined by the magical properties (if any) of the weapon being used.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Determining Attack Outcomes</h2><p>The attack is a hit if the result of the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense score of the target. If the result of the attack roll is less than the Defense score, the attack is ineffective. For attacks which target Physical Defense the nature of the miss (Deflected, Blocked, Dodged, or Parried) is further determined by the component Physical Defense scores of the target creature.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Overflow and Damage</h2><p>The amount by which the Attack Roll exceeded the Defense score is called <strong>Overflow</strong>. This Overflow amount is multiplied by a <strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> which is usually 1, but occasionally higher or lower. Then any additive <strong>Damage Bonus</strong> is applied, and lastly any <strong>Resistance</strong> possessed by the target creature is subtracted from the result.</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Overflow</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Attack Roll - Defense Score</p></section><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Damage</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">(Overflow × Damage Multiplier) + Damage Bonus - Target Resistance</p></section><p>While Damage Resistance is a powerful way for creatures to reduce incoming damage, such damage cannot be mitigated entirely. Abilities which deal direct (immediate) damage that surpass the target's Defense Score always deal at least 1 point of damage to their target Resource.</p><p>Abilities which deal indirect damage-over-time, however, can have the effects of that indirect damage reduced to zero by Resistance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Critical Hits and Misses</h2><p>If the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Hit Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>. Similarly if the Attack Roll is lower than the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Miss Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Miss</strong>.</p><p>A Critical Hit does not directly increase the damage of an attack - although because of the way that Overflow contributes to total damage, Critical Hits always deal more damage than normal hits.</p><p>Critical Hits and Critical Misses present opportunities for other things to occur.

When a creature is <strong>Engaged</strong> with a number of creatures greater than its <strong>Engagement</strong> score it has the <strong>Flanked</strong> condition.

Krag can engage with three opposing combatants simultaneously without them acquiring any Flanking bonus against him. However if Krag is surrounded by five Goblins, he would have the <strong>Flanked 2</strong> condition and each Goblin's attacks would benefit from <strong>+2 Boons (5 engaged enemies - 3 Engagement)</strong>.</p></section><p>While having more Engaged enemies increases your Flanked condition, having adjacent allies who are supporting you can nullify flanking. Allies contribute their own <strong>Engagement</strong> as a bonus to yours if you share enemies in common that you are both Engaged with.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><p>Krag, from our previous example, is still surrounded by 5 Goblins and is <strong>Flanked 2</strong>. His ally Jinora comes to join the fray. Jinora has an <strong>Engagement</strong> score of <strong>2</strong>. When Jinora moves next to Krag, and into a position where Jinora can engage at least 2 of the Goblins, Krag's Flanked condition is removed because Jinora's 2 Engagement adds to Krag's own Engagement score, allowing Krag to engage up to 5 enemies.</p></section><section class=\"foundryvtt\"><p>A status effect condition when a creature is <strong>Flanked</strong> is automatically computed and added whenever a character moves into or out of <strong>Engagement</strong> with other adversaries.

Two of the four goblins may move away from Krag without reciprocity, because Krag is otherwise <strong>Fully Engaged</strong> and therefore cannot retaliate. When the third goblin moves away, however, Krag spends 1 Focus point to perform a <strong>Disengagement Strike</strong>, burying his battle axe in the back of the retreating evildoer!</p></section><p>There is a safe means of retreating from melee combat, which is to <strong>Move Cautiously</strong>.

The ease of adjusting the <strong>Level</strong> or <strong>Threat</strong> of an @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.v1dqTT3NI35lFNxM.JournalEntryPage.WH0YSVcYo09aHNZ2]{adversary } makes it easy to adjust an encounter to this point of balance ahead of time. </p><p>Encounters balanced in this way have an approximately 50% chance of going in the party's favor and a 50% chance of going in the enemies' favor.

Since adversaries do not have <strong>Wounds</strong>, only <strong>Health</strong> this is an intentional advantage in favor of Hero characters.</p><p>In any single balanced encounter if the heroes get lucky or play well, they will win without suffering any <strong>Wounds</strong>.

Wounds are a mechanism to regulate swings in luck while also requiring the party to be effective combatants most of the time.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">The Role of the Gamemaster</h2><p>Lastly, the <strong>Gamemaster</strong> plays a pivotal role in ensuring the fun and balance of combat. Enemies in Crucible are generally optimized such that they can be very effective at their main combat style. This is done because we assume that player characters are also designed and progressed with — to at least some extent — combat effectiveness in mind.</p><p>It is not a goal of Crucible to <em>require</em> that every player character be maximally optimized or that every decision in combat be one that optimizes for victory rather than advancing the story being told. It is therefore important that the Gamemaster to calibrate the optimization of their own play to match the party and the needs of the storytelling moment.</p><p>Adversaries in Crucible can and should be fallible in the decisions that they make. Enemies can, and often should, spend their Action and Focus in combat on actions that maintain tension and stakes while prioritizing the needs of the story rather than actions that specifically optimize to defeat the heroes.</p>"

Gestures determine the shape a spell will take as it is translated from the raw magical energies governed by a Rune into a manifestation of that power. Gestures set particular properties of a magical spell, usually the cost in Action and Focus points, range (or size), targeting type, and shape. Gestures also determine one-half of the scaling damage formula, with Rune as the other half.</p><h2>Arrow</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Hurl a projectile of magical power at a distant target. This might use the Lightning Rune to hurl a lightning bolt, or the Shadow rune to hurl a ball of devouring darkness.</p><h2>Aspect</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Infuse the essence of a Rune into the self, empowering the physical form or psyche.</p><p>When you assume a certain Aspect, you become more closely attuned to the damage type of the Rune used in your spell. You gain <strong>+2 Resistance</strong> to that damage type, and deal an additional <strong>+2 Damage</strong> whenever dealing damage of that type.</p><h2>Create</h2><p><em>2 Hands, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Coalesce arcane power into tangible form, conjuring a <strong>Creation</strong> which appears in an adjacent space and joins Combat at Initiative 1.</p><p>Your Creation is a Minion of half your own Level chosen from the Summoned Creatures compendium pack corresponding to the Rune used in the spell.</p><h2>Fan</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Focus the essence of a rune into a sweeping or splintered arc to strike multiple targets in close proximity. If used with Earth, this might hurl a spray of stone in an arc, while using it with Kinesis might carve a slice across multiple foes.</p><h2>Influence</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Channel concentrated arcane energy through a single target via touch. If used with the rune of Life this would create a powerful healing effect, while used with the touch of Lightning would provide a powerful jolt of Electrical damage.</p><h2>Pulse</h2><p><em>2 Hands, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Emit a burst of Runic power in a circular wave that travels outward, with you at its center. A Pulse of Spirit might be used to bolster Morale for your allies, while a Death pulse might be used to deal Corruption damage to a group of enemies gathered around you.</p><h2>Ray</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Focus the power of a Rune into a single point, expelling its energy into a ranged beam which rapidly travels a short distance to a targeted area. If used with Life this might restore the HP of a distant ally steadily over time, while Frost might emit a beam that freezes a target in place.</p><h2>Step</h2><p><em>0 Hands , 1 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Infuse runic power into a movement, crossing physical and spatial boundaries. Move 4 spaces in a straight line, dealing minor damage to enemies or applying restoration to allies in your path.</p><h2>Strike</h2><p><em>0 Hands, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Empower a close-range attack with the essence of a Rune. This rune performs a melee weapon attack targeting the defense and dealing damage of the Rune used in the spell.</p><h2>Touch</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 1 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Manifest the power of a Rune to pass its essence through physical contact. Used with Death this might deal damage to a target within arm's reach, while using it with Control might cause the target you touch to do your bidding.</p><h2>Ward</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 1 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Focus the power of a Rune into a protective barrier, shielding yourselves and others from harmful effects. When used with the Kinesis rune the Ward reduces incoming damage from a chosen physical damage type while combination with the Death rune protects against Corruption damage.</p>"

The Compose inflection reduces the <strong>Focus</strong> cost of a spell by 1 while increasing its <strong>Action</strong> cost by 1 in exchange.</p><h2>Determine</h2><p><em><strong>(+1 Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance a spell to make it more difficult to counter. Any attempt to Counter-Spell this spell is made with +2 Banes.</p><h2>Extend</h2><p><em><strong>(+1 Action, +1 Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance the duration of a spell, increasing the duration of its effect.

This spell does not provide any opportunity to make reactions that involve Strike attacks, regardless of the results of the spell.</p><h2>Negate</h2><p><em><strong>(+1 Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Invert the effect of a spell. An Inverted Life Touch spell which normally heals a target deals Poison damage instead. An Inverted Death Ward spell inflicts vulnerability to Corruption damage upon an adjacent enemy.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>The effects of the Negate inflection are not yet automated for Playtest 1.

Creating and advancing a character in Crucible should be enjoyable and impactful as you gain access to new capabilities that tangibly evolve your playstyle and character persona.</p><h2>Strategic Grid-Based Combat</h2><p>Game mechanics in Crucible are designed for application to encounter or area maps with a structured grid which defines distances and positions of characters to create tactical choices about movement during combat. Movement actions and costs, engagement, flanking, cover, area-of-effect abilities, and more are all ways to add tactical nuance and dynamism to combat.</p><h2>Consistently Automated Mechanics</h2><p>A key goal for Crucible is to design and implement mechanics which are seamlessly automated or theoretically capable of seamless automation. We don't want automation that distracts from gameplay with the need for bookkeeping - but we also want the underlying game mechanics which are automated to be understandable to players at the table. We don't want mechanics which are inscrutable simply because we have a layer of automation in front of them. In Crucible you will find game mechanics which are elegantly and intuitively designed, but our approach to full automation of those mechanics means you can stay focused on the fun of roleplaying.</p><h2>Bring Your Own Story</h2><p>Crucible is optimized and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out over months or years of game sessions.</p><p>Crucible provides relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships - deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they most prefer.</p><p>Crucible intentionally does not define a canonical setting. The system provides Gamemasters with tools to apply the system to a variety of settings. As a general rule of thumb, Crucible will work best in a gritty fantasy setting but it can be adapted for other genres and tones.</p><h2>Ease of Powerful Use</h2><p>Crucible is designed to be a system which is easy to learn and easy to use. Gamemasters should feel empowered to tell the stories they want to tell, and players to play the characters they want to play. We want game mechanics in Crucible to be crunchy and strategic while being presented to players in a way that is intuitive and fun to engage with.</p>"
